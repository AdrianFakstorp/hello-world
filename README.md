Tutorial


This is a test document for me to practice using branches from a master. The ultimate goal for me here is to upload my Case Project from my dropbox and have it in a functioning format on GitHub for everyone to be able to use and see, should they choose.

From there, it will also be substantially easier for me to make edits instead of the current "sandbox" system that I am using. The Github method of making edits is also a safer way to do it while keeping a better way of having it organized
